All files with .tnk extensions are source assembly files.
The source assembly files are included to show you what the program does. It is not used by your code.
All files with .obj extensions are object files. These are the binary files that should be read and interpreted by your code.
All codes start at address 0x0. 
Input and output ports are used to provide input and output, respectively.
Convention:
Port 0 (input or output) is for integers.
Port 1 (input or output) is for characters.
Port 2 (input or output) is for floating point numbers.
You should load the binary file into your memory array and start executing at address zero.

Files:
0. hello:
	A program that does what every first program does :-)
	Expected output: Hello World!
1. arithmetic:
	A program that tests the arithmetic instructions.
	Expected output: It prints 22
2. Logic: 
	A program that tests the logic instructions.
	Expected output: It prints !. If it prints ?, then you have a problem!
3. fact6: 
	A program to compute the factorial of 6. 
	Expected output: It prints 720
