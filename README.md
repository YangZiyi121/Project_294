 CPU simulator

Please pull the repo and edit on top of it. 

I created a main function for testing inside Shifter.cpp. If you want to test your functional part, please comment it. 

I changed a little bit on the receive_clock() function inside Latch class. It is now returning a long long type result for debugging.

Feel free to change it if there is something wrong. 

Good luck!
